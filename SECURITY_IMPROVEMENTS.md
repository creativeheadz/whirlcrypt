# üîí Whirlcrypt Security Improvements - Wormhole-Inspired Enhancements

This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements implemented in Whirlcrypt, inspired by Wormhole's battle-tested security model.

## üìã Implementation Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced Security Headers
**Status: COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**What was implemented:**
- **Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)**: `same-origin` - Prevents other origins from accessing data
- **Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP)**: `require-corp` - Enables cross-origin isolation
- **Permissions Policy**: Disables unnecessary browser features (camera, microphone, geolocation, etc.)
- **Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)**: `same-origin` - Prevents window.opener access
- **Enhanced HSTS**: Added `preload` directive for production

**Security Benefits:**
- Mitigates side-channel hardware vulnerabilities (Meltdown, Spectre)
- Ensures browser isolation for enhanced security
- Reduces attack surface by disabling unused browser APIs
- Prevents cross-origin data leakage

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/middleware/security.ts` - Enhanced security headers middleware

#### 2. Stricter Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Status: COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**What was implemented:**
- **Nonce-based CSP**: Removed `'unsafe-inline'` and implemented cryptographic nonces
- **Strict Dynamic**: Uses `'strict-dynamic'` for script loading
- **CSP Violation Reporting**: Added `/api/security/csp-report` endpoint
- **Monitoring**: CSP-Report-Only header for violation tracking

**Security Benefits:**
- Eliminates XSS attack vectors from inline scripts/styles
- Provides cryptographic proof of script legitimacy
- Real-time monitoring of CSP violations
- Defense-in-depth against code injection

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/middleware/security.ts` - CSP middleware with nonce generation
- `backend/src/routes/security.ts` - CSP violation reporting endpoint

#### 3. Supply Chain Security Integration

**What was implemented:**
- **Socket.dev Integration**: Automated dependency scanning for malware
- **NPM Audit**: Enhanced vulnerability scanning
- **License Checking**: Automated license compliance verification
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Security Scripts**: Easy-to-use npm scripts for security audits

**Security Benefits:**
- Detects malicious packages before they enter the codebase

- Automated vulnerability detection and reporting
- Continuous security monitoring in development workflow

**Files Created:**
- `socket.yml` - Socket.dev configuration
- `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Automated security scanning workflow

**Files Modified:**

- `frontend/package.json` - Security audit scripts
- `package.json` - Root-level security scripts

#### 4. Metadata Encryption (Wormhole-Inspired)
**Status: COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**What was implemented:**
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive file metadata
- **HKDF Key Derivation**: Secure key derivation from master key
- **Privacy Protection**: Hashes IP addresses and user agents
- **Database Integration**: Encrypted metadata stored in database
- **Zero-Knowledge Enhancement**: Original filenames/types not stored in plaintext

**Security Benefits:**
- Protects user privacy even if database is compromised
- Prevents metadata leakage to administrators
- Enhanced zero-knowledge architecture
- Follows Wormhole's metadata protection patterns

**Files Created:**
- `backend/src/services/MetadataEncryption.ts` - Metadata encryption service

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/storage/FileManagerV2.ts` - Integrated metadata encryption
- `backend/src/database/models/File.ts` - Added encrypted metadata field
- `backend/src/types.ts` - Updated FileMetadata interface
- `backend/database/schema.sql` - Added encrypted_metadata column
- `backend/src/routes/upload.ts` - Pass IP/User-Agent for encryption
- `backend/.env.example` - Added metadata encryption key config

#### 5. Certificate Transparency Monitoring
**Status: COMPLETE** ‚úÖ

**What was implemented:**
- **CT Log Monitoring**: Monitors multiple Certificate Transparency logs
- **Suspicious Certificate Detection**: Identifies potential phishing/typosquatting
- **Automated Alerting**: Real-time alerts for certificate misissuance
- **Scheduled Monitoring**: Automated periodic checks (every 6 hours)
- **Admin Dashboard Integration**: CT monitoring status and controls

**Security Benefits:**
- Early detection of certificate misissuance attacks
- Protection against phishing and typosquatting
- Compliance with modern security monitoring practices
- Proactive threat detection and response

**Files Created:**
- `backend/src/services/CertificateTransparencyMonitor.ts` - CT monitoring service
- `backend/src/jobs/certificateMonitoring.ts` - Scheduled CT monitoring job

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Integrated CT monitoring startup
- `backend/src/routes/admin.ts` - Added CT monitoring admin endpoints
- `backend/package.json` - Added axios dependency
- `backend/.env.example` - Added CT monitoring configuration

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables Added

```bash
# Metadata Encryption
METADATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-32-byte-base64-key-here

# Certificate Transparency Monitoring
CT_MONITOR_ENABLED=true
CT_MONITOR_DOMAINS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com,api.yourdomain.com
CT_MONITOR_SCHEDULE=0 */6 * * *
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

### New NPM Scripts

```bash
# Security auditing
npm run security:audit          # Run security audit
npm run security:socket         # Run Socket.dev scan
npm run security:deps           # Combined dependency scanning
npm run security:licenses       # License compliance check
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Deploy Enhanced Headers**: Low-risk, immediate security benefits
2. **Enable Supply Chain Scanning**: Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
3. **Configure Metadata Encryption**: Generate and set encryption key
4. **Setup CT Monitoring**: Configure domains and enable monitoring
5. **Update CSP**: Test nonce-based CSP in staging environment

### Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Generate secure `METADATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- [ ] Configure `CT_MONITOR_DOMAINS` with your actual domains
- [ ] Test CSP nonce implementation with your frontend
- [ ] Setup Socket.dev account for enhanced scanning
- [ ] Configure security alerting endpoints
- [ ] Update monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Train team on new security features

## üìä Security Impact

### Before vs After Comparison

| Security Aspect | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Headers** | Basic security headers | Wormhole-level headers with CORP/COEP | üî• High |
| **CSP** | Basic CSP with unsafe-inline | Nonce-based strict CSP | üî• High |
| **Supply Chain** | Manual dependency checks | Automated malware detection | üî• High |
| **Metadata** | Plaintext in database | AES-256-GCM encrypted | üî• High |
| **Certificate Monitoring** | None | Automated CT log monitoring | üî• High |

### Security Posture Enhancement
